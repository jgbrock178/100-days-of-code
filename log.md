# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through FreeCodeComp tutorials. 

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeComp initial tutorials a bit boring as most of the basics I already know, but good to get through it. Will be more interesting as I get to more difficult/unknown topics.
